## Lyrics

Input, processing, output

Let’s all sing about

Input, processing, output

That’s how computers work.

Input is a request, 

Usually expressed by the press of a keyboard screen

That sends a signal but it’s not as simple as it seems

Because then it gets converted into 0s and 1s, 

They call that binary code, 

While a system called the OS keeps things smooth 

And helps handle a load

Next up is processing, which is even more astonishing, 

Cause so many caulculations happen so fast, 

To do just what you ask

And what feels like no time, 

It’s show time, when whatever you wanted appeared, 

Before your eyes and ears, 

(That’s output!)

So lets now put, it all together, One more time let’s sing,

Input, processing, output, It’s all about,

Input, processing, output, that’s how computers work.
